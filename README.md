#### Prompt / Colors

I'm all for a minimal prompt that focuses on the commands being run and their
output.

### Dotfiles

The README file in my dotfiles repo contains installation instructions for
all of the tools that I use on the command line. It's catered towards native
Linux (Debian / Ubuntu) and WSL but there's macOS instructions too.

This link leads to the master branch of my dotfiles:

- <https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles>

Here's a list of specific config files as they were at the time of this talk:

- [.profile](https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles/blob/73ed4a38d66fc2a2fb45bec112680a1bae2cff75/.profile)
- [.bashrc](https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles/blob/73ed4a38d66fc2a2fb45bec112680a1bae2cff75/.bashrc)
- [.aliases](https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles/blob/73ed4a38d66fc2a2fb45bec112680a1bae2cff75/.aliases)
- [.tmux.conf](https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles/blob/73ed4a38d66fc2a2fb45bec112680a1bae2cff75/.tmux.conf)
- [.vimrc](https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles/blob/73ed4a38d66fc2a2fb45bec112680a1bae2cff75/.vimrc)

#### Notable Tools

In case something crazy happens with my dotfiles repo in the future, here's a
list of command line tools mentioned and demonstrated in the talk:

- <https://github.com/tmux/tmux>
- <https://github.com/vim/vim>
- <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf>
- <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep>

#### Getting set up with WSL 2

This video goes over my entire WSL 2 set up and also includes non-command line
tools that I use on Windows. It's basically a 30 minute drive-by of everything
I use and how I have everything configured.

Also, here's a [a complete list of all of the tools I
use](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/the-tools-i-use) on Windows in text form.

#### Dotfiles Management

If you don't want to use symlinks, there are dedicated tools such as
<https://yadm.io/> and many others.

Also, check out the [XDG Base Directory
Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
to learn more about where user specific files should go.
